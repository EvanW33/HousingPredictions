This is a kaggle.com challenge for predicting housing prices. I used one hot encoding from pandas, preprocessing from sklearn, and SVR from sklearn.

Libraries needed:
1. numpy
2. pandas
3. sklearn

to run:
   Download the test and training CSV file. Move to the folder in terminal and type python3 housingPrices.py

The submissions.csv should be the output with the predictions along with some other print statements will be displayed in the terminal. This is a mini project I'm doing to build up my project list over the next few years in goals of getting a good data science/machine learning/programming job.
